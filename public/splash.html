                        <p>1. The board always starts with 2 white disks and 2 black disks placed across each other (as the picture below).
                            The player with black disk goes first.</p>
                        <p>2. The black disk must be placed where there exists at least one straight (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) 
                            occupied line between the new disk and another black disk, with one or more contiguous white disks between them (as seen below).</p>
                        <p>3. The black disk must be placed where there exists at least one straight (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) occupied line between the new disk and another black disk, 
                            with one or more contiguous white disks between them (as seen below).</p>
                        <p>4. Next, it is the turn for the player with white disk. </p>
                        <p>5. The rule for the player with white disk of placing the disk is the same with instruction 3. </p>
                        <p>6. Next, it is the turn for the player with black disk. If one player is unable to connect an occupied line with the disk with the color assigned to him/her on the other side, play passes back to the other player. Shifts goes on and on. 
                            When neither player can move, the game ends. At the end of the game, the player with the most pieces on the board wins.</p>
                        <p>Hint: the grids with dark shadow on the board will be the possible places to place a disk. </p>
